# üîé Port Scanner in Python (Educational)

This project is a basic port scanner created for educational purposes. It simulates the reconnaissance technique used by attackers and defenders to identify open services on a network.

## üéØ Objective

To explore the "Port Scanning" technique in the reconnaissance phase of offensive and defensive cybersecurity.

## üöÄ How it works?

- The script asks for an IP and a range of ports.
- It attempts to connect to each port using sockets.
- If a port is open, it reports it to the screen.
- It uses threads to speed up the process.

## üìö Concepts Applied

- Python (socket, threading)
- Networking and TCP ports
- Offensive/defensive security
- MITRE ATT&CK: Technique T1046 (Network Service Discovery)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important

> This project is **for educational use only** and should be tested in controlled environments (e.g., localhost or your own network). **Do not use it to scan networks without authorization.**
